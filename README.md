TaskSquirrel is a playful iOS app that helps parents motivate their kids to complete chores. Users can attach photos as proof of task completion, and the app displays the photo's location on a map, turning tasks into a scavenger hunt. With features like photo picking and custom map annotations, TaskSquirrel makes chores engaging and interactive.
